This CiviCRM native extension allows a back-office user to associate a contribution with an automated recurring contribution schedule. This can be useful when an automated contribution schedule experiences a missed transaction (such as the credit card was over its spending limit, or a Direct Debit failed) and the donor/member has mailed a check to cover the missing transaction.
  
  
  This has been tested with Authorize.net, PayPalPro, and eWay. Since there is no payment processor-specific code in this extension, it should work with any payment processor that offers automated recurring contributions, but further testing is needed to verify this assumption.
